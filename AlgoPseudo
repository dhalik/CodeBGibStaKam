NOTES:

-Start by waiting 6-7 ticks OR bid-ask spread is smaller 

-When bids are decreasing, don't buy. When we see the slope now increasing, buy
	-When 3 period moving average goes from negative to positive

-Try to estimate dividends: Get next period earnings from Volatility
	-Constantly record decrease in dividend given and try to find distribution
	-Want decreasing flat slope stock so we get most dividends and earnigns are good

-Using volatility distribution
	-Less volatile distribution when earnings are high should give good dividends

-See how much one person can push the bid ask price by buying a lot of one thing 
	-OR rotate buying a different stock , holding and selling over and over again


-Similar on ASK side

-Look for free negative bid arbitrage
	-Buy for 1-5 cents higher, next period sell for 1-5 cent higher
